### UBILABS TEST 1

# HTML

Let start with an simple HTML test.

### Your task

Create an HTML page that shows a simple login form with a button, an email and a password field. As soon as the user hits "submit", the page should prevent them from submitting the form with a simple message when something is wrong.

- Must work in latest Chrome.
- No styling needed.
- Keep it as simple as possible.

Sounds easy. And it is easy if done right.
